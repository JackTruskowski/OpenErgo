# OpenErgo

![alt tag](https://github.com/JackTruskowski/OpenErgo/blob/master/layout/layout.png)

A repo for my custom keyboard project: An open-source, semi-ergonomic, emacs-oriented
keyboard with trackpoint. (Say that 5 times fast). This project may
never be completed so enter at your own risk. Contributions are always welcome.
